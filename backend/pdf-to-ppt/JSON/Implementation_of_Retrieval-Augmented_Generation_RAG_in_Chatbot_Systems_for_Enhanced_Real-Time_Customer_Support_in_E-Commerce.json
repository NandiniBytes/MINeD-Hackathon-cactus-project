The RAG-based \nchatbot addresses this by retrieving relevant information \nfrom sources like product catalogs, FAQs, and customer \nreviews and generating responses tailored to specific \nqueries. This approach ensures accurate, contextually \nrelevant answers that improve customer satisfaction, \nstreamline service processes, and reduce errors. By \nleveraging the RAG framework, this solution provides \nrobust, scalable customer support that enhances \nengagement and optimizes the e-commerce experience. \nKeywords-python, RAG, virtual experience, LLMs, E-\ncommerce, Embedding, assistance, customer care, \nVectors, Vector Database, GPT, tokens, BERTs, Services, \nEnhancement. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn recent years, the demand for real-time customer \nassistance in e-commerce has surged, driven by a shift \ntoward \nonline \nservices \nand \nincreasing \ncustomer \nexpectations. As businesses strive to provide seamless, \nefficient support, traditional customer service methods, \nsuch as human-operated helpdesks, are struggling to keep \nup with high inquiry volumes. Meeting these demands \nrequires scalable and personalized solutions, both crucial \nfor maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty.  \nTo address these challenges, AI-driven chatbots have \nemerged as promising tools, offering benefits such as \nreduced wait times, enhanced response efficiency, and \n24/7 availability. However, existing chatbot models often \nlack the capability to handle complex queries or retrieve \ncontext-specific information accurately, especially in a \nfast-paced and competitive e-commerce environment.
