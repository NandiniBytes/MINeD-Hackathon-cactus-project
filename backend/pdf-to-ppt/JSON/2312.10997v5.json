Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged\nas a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external\ndatabases.

INTRODUCTION\nL\nARGE language models (LLMs) have achieved remark-\nable success, though they still face significant limitations,\nespecially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks [1],\nnotably producing \u201challucinations\u201d [2] when handling queries\nbeyond their training data or requiring current information. To\novercome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nenhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from\nexternal knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu-\nlation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively\nreduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content.\nIts integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption,\nestablishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots\nand enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica-\ntions.\nRAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and\nthe technology tree summarizing related research is shown\nCorresponding Author.Email:haofen.wang@tongji.edu.cn\n1Resources\nare\navailable\nat\nhttps://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/\nRAG-Survey\nin Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era\nof large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics.\nInitially, RAG\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of the\nTransformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language\nmodels by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre-\nTraining Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized\nby foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques\n[3]\u2013[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a\npivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context\nlearning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards\nproviding better information for LLMs to answer more com-\nplex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage,\nleading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research\nprogressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited\nto the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM\nfine-tuning techniques.\nThe burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth,\nyet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that\ncould clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to\nfill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting\nits evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the\nintegration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both\ntechnical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three\nmain research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and\nanalyzing key technologies in the core stages of \u201cRetrieval,\u201d\n\u201cGeneration,\u201d and \u201cAugmentation.\u201d On the other hand, current\nresearch tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and\nsummarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper compre-\nhensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks,\nand evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this\npaper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the\nfoundational technical concepts, historical progression, and\nthe spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that\nhave emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and\nprofessionals with a detailed and structured understanding of\nboth large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution\nof retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and\nweaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts,\nand speculate on upcoming trends and innovations.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 In this survey, we present a thorough and systematic\nreview of the state-of-the-art RAG methods, delineating\nits evolution through paradigms including naive RAG,\narXiv:2312.10997v5  [cs.CL]  27 Mar 2024",
