The human-like intelligence of Gen-\nerative AI has been fundamental in driving this transformation\nacross the sector.

INTRODUCTION\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming\nhealthcare by leading a paradigm shift in the application of\nAI across its spectrum of functions, from public health to\ntreatment and recovery [1], [2]. State-of-the-art Generative\nAI models, such as GPT4 by OpenAI, PaLM 2 by Google\nDeepMind, LLaMa by Meta AI, have introduced innovative\napproaches to healthcare that are capable of handling diverse\ncomplex tasks and providing clinical decision support [3],\n[4]. Furthermore, these models have demonstrated advanced\nconversational abilities in healthcare [5], [6], leading to the\ndevelopment of specialized models like Med-PaLM [7] and\nChatDoctor [8] with major performance improvements in\nmedical dialogues and patient-physician interactions [9].\nDespite these capabilities and performance gains, Genera-\ntive AI is not without significant limitations. Widely known\nas \u201cAI hallucinations\u201d, Generative AI models are known to\nfabricate information in its naive effort to provide a response\nto every query, even though it may not have been trained\non datasets relevant to such queries. Vague prompts, static\nparametric knowledge, limited domain expertise, insufficient\ntraining data, and uncertainties in language interpretation are\nfurther limitations that have emerged following the widespread\nuse of Generative AI in practical applications [10]. These limi-\ntations have been further explored in recent studies in terms of\nthe productivity paradox that is pre-existing at the intersection\nbetween technology and healthcare [11]. The productivity\nparadox is simply defined as the decrease in workplace pro-\nductivity despite an increase in technology investment. The\ntwo typical reasons for productivity paradox are premature\nadoption and resistance to change. Premature adoption is due\nto unrecognised limitations of early versions of technologies\nthat lead to a degradation of usage, while resistance to change\nis primarily due to the absence of adequate training and change\nmanagement when introducing a new technology.\nIn addressing the case of productivity paradox in Generative\nAI, RAG represents an effective approach, diverging from the\nuse of raw LLMs or their fine-tuning with task-specific data,\nby merging the capabilities of retrieval-based and generative\nmodels [12]. Domain adaptation by incorporating external\nknowledge sources, RAG enhances the accuracy and rele-\nvance of generated text which allows to provide contextually\nappropriate responses. This approach further validates the\nrapid domain adoption of RAG as a significant solution in\nmitigating the productivity paradox in healthcare, demonstrat-\ning its potential in bridging the gap between advanced AI\ncapabilities and practical, efficient medical service delivery.\nFurthermore, there is an escalating interest in AI agents that\nleverage generative AI and the capabilities of LLMs. These\nagents are capable of performing various tasks with minimal\nhuman intervention by interacting with external tools, and they\npossess the ability to engage in conversations, reason, increase\nefficiency, improve precision, and provide insights.\nIn this study, we present the design and development of a\nRetrieval Augmented Generative AI Chatbot framework for\nconsultation summaries, diagnostic insights, and emotional\nassessments of patients. Integrating external data repositories\nand information produced through analysis via the RAG archi-\ntecture allows for the enrichment of results using Generative\nAI models. We further demonstrate the technical value of\nthis framework in service innovation, patient engagement\nand workflow efficiencies that collectively move to address\nthe productivity paradox of AI in healthcare. The rest of\nthe paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces the\nframework and related work, followed by the capabilities of\nthe framework which are demonstrated in Section III and\nSection IV concludes the paper.\n2024 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT) | 979-8-3503-4026-6/24/$31.00 \u00a92024 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICIT58233.2024.10540818\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Nirma University Institute of Technology.
