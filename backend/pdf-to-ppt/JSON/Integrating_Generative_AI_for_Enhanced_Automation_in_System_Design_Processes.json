INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) has assisted in a transformative era across\nmultiple domains, ranging from natural language processing\ncomputer vision to complex decision-making systems [1].\nThis surge in Gen AI Market, especially in AI-driven inno-\nvation, is primarily characterized by the model\u2019s ability to\ngenerate novel content, interpret complex data, and provide\npreviously unattainable solutions with traditional computa-\ntional approaches. Among the different kinds of applications,\none of the most notable is the integration of Gen AI and\nLLMs in System Engineering (SE), particularly in System\ndesign. This integration promises to enhance the efficiency\nand effectiveness of design processes and introduces novel\nmethodologies for tackling intricate engineering challenges.\nThis research aims to answer the question: How can Gen\nAI improve the efficiency and accuracy of system design in\ncomplex systems such as autonomous transportation, traffic\nnetworks, and cloud-based software systems?\nGen AI, particularly through LLMs, has revolutionized SE,\na field traditionally reliant on human expertise [2]. System\nDesign, a critical phase in SE, involves creating complex\nblueprints that define system architecture, components, and\ninterconnections. LLMs automate design tasks, generate inno-\nvative solutions, and provide insights from vast data, enabling\nrapid creation and evaluation of multiple design alternatives.\nThis accelerates the design process, reduces costs, and en-\nhances system quality [3].\nHowever, integrating Gen AI into system design poses\nchallenges. The complexity and criticality of system designs in\nvarious industries demand that LLM-generated outputs meet\nhigh standards of accuracy, reliability, and safety. Rigorous\nevaluation techniques are essential to verify the technical\nviability and compliance with industry standards, regulatory\nrequirements, and ethical considerations. This paper introduces\nmethods for system design using Gen AI to generate design\ninformation and discusses our proposed evaluation techniques.\nOur goal is to create a Gen AI-based platform for generating\nand evaluating Design Document (DesDoc) based on user\nrequirements and system design principles.\nII. GEN AI IN SYSTEM ENGINEERING\nA. Use of LLM in the System Design Phase\nThe system design phase is pivotal in determining a system\u2019s\nfunctionality, performance, and overall success. It involves\nintricate processes, including requirement analysis, concep-\ntual design, architectural design, and detailed design. The\nutilization of LLMs in the System Design Phase represents\na paradigm shift in how engineers approach these design\nprocesses. LLMs can analyze vast amounts of data, extract\npatterns, and generate complex outputs that aid decision-\nmaking and problem-solving. By leveraging these powers,\nLLMs enable engineers to streamline design tasks, enhance\ncreativity, and optimize system performance.\nB. System Design Evaluation\nSystem Design Evaluation is essential in engineering to\nensure proposed designs meet specifications, performance cri-\nteria, and safety standards. It validates functionality, efficiency,\nand reliability, reducing risks and costs. Traditionally, this\ninvolves analytical methods, simulations, and empirical testing\nto confirm operational requirements.\nHowever, conventional methods can be resource-intensive,\ntime-consuming, and sometimes impractical for complex sys-\ntems.
