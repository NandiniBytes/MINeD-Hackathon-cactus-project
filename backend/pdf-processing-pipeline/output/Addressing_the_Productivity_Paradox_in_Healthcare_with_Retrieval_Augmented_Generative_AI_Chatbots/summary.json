{"summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the health-care landscape through diverse innovations, personalisations and decision-making capabilities. Despite large investments and some early successes, several studies have signalled the emergence of a productivity paradox. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of Retrieval Augmented Generative AI Chatbots. We present the Retrieval Augmented GenerativeAI Chatbot framework for consultation summaries, diagnosticinsights, and emotional assessments of patients. We further demonstrate the technical value of this framework in service \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0innovation, patient engagement and workflow efficiencies. Generative AI models have demonstrated advanced conversational abilities in healthcare. Despite these capabilities and performance gains, Generative AI is not without significant limitations. Vague prompts, limited domain expertise, insufficient training data, and uncertainties in language interpretation are further limitations that have emerged. The productivity paradox is a decrease in workplace pro- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ductivity despite an increase in technology investment. The typical reasons for productivity paradox are premature adoption and resistance to change. RAG represents an effective approach, diverging from the use of raw LLMs or fine-tuning with task-specific data. In this study, we present the design and development of a Retrieval Augmented Generative AI Chatbot framework for consultation summaries, diagnostic insights, and emotionalassessments of patients. Integrating external data repositories and information produced through analysis via the RAG archi- grotesquetecture allows for the enrichment of res. 2024 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT) | 979-8-3503-4026-6/24/$31.00.

The framework introduces three analysis mod- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ules for patient telehealth conversation summarisation, diseasediagnosis and treatment and emotion analysis. The end-users of this system, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the healthcare professionals can interact with this platform through a chatbot interface. The following subsections provide further details of the modules and this framework. Data is amalgamated from validated and reliable sources including publications, clinical trials, and observational studies. The entirety of the data is consolidated into a cohesive data model, which can be established using adata lakehouse. LangChain is a robust framework for developing applications using LLMs. This study explores a self-verification framework with LLMs such as GPT-4 for efficient extraction of patient information from healthcare texts. LangChain is a comprehensive text summarisation library leveraging LLMs. It will facilitate effi-phthalcient analysis of patient conversations. The module is adept at extracting and highlighting key aspects such as symptoms, side effects, concerns, treatment and medication. BioBERT is anadaptation of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representationsfrom Transformers) model. Spark NLP an open-source text processing library leverages LLMs for advanced information extraction. Disease diagnosis module supports healthcare pro- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0fessionals in early disease detection. A recent study demonstrates the ability of GPT-3 to diag-nose medical conditions nearly as accurately as physicians. A further study using GPT4 highlights its enhanced ability in conducting diagnoses and triage. Researchers at GoogleResearch and DeepMind have developed Med-PaLM 2. Unsupervised methods like clustering algorithms and dimensionalityreduction techniques will be applied to detect patterns, anomalies, and clusters in disease detection. Evaluating feature importance with methods like SHAP is crucial for understanding the impact of each attribute on model predictions. This module supports clinicians to understand and address complex emotional states of patients. \u2018Chatcounselor\u2019 is a specialised LLMtrained on real conversations between psychologists and clients. This AI-based emotion model is designed for adaptability. The model also possesses the capability to discern emotion intensities and is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0adept at managing negations. It can detect subtle indications of depression, anxiety, stress, or suicidal thoughts expressed by the patient. We will be using a lexicon drivenapproach to define similar words associated with each emotion. Emotion models can be used to generate context-specific emotions,negations and intensifiers. Efforts are also in progress to test the feasibility of emotion detection using few-shot learning techniques. The RAG architecture initiates with data loading and trans-formation component. Once the context-specific data and data from the three analysis components are imported, they undergo a transformation process to be broken down into manageable segments. The effectiveness of the system relies heavily on the quality and structure of these chunks. LangChain [30] and LlamaIndex [31] are two robust frameworks that facilitate the implementation of RAG. LangChain specialises in conver- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0sational retrieval agents that are fine-tuned for engaging in conversations and performing retrieval tasks as needed. In the design of the retrieval agent, we are experimenting with OpenAI ChatModels such as GPT-3.5-turbo. The conversational retrieval agent skillfully processes the query through its interaction with the ChatModel and retrieves relevant information. Clinical entities identified by the medical NER pipeline are highlighted in the patient summary. Lung cancer predictive model was developed using data from a lung cancer patient cohort. The XGBoost model, with the highest F1 score of 93.02%, was selected for its superior performance. The consultant has the capability to inquire about theipientpatient\u2019s emotional and mental health status through the. onversational agent. We have developed a customised emotion model that includes fourpositive and four negative emotions. The professional can access these emotion profiles on either a call-specific or patient-specific basis. Having access to emotion transition profiles at both the call and patient.levels equips telehealth consultants with valuable information to better prepare for upcoming consultations. RAG AI chatbot has the potential to address the productivityparalleparadox by improving the efficiency of information processing and decision-making. The chatbot offers scalable and customis- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0able solutions, and continually learning and improving over time.
